• Business trips dominate the dataset, contributing to 94% of the total distance  travelled. 

• Afternoon hours (1 PM - 4 PM) experience the highest ride activity, while Q4  emerges as the most active quarter.

• The "Others" category accounted for the most trip purposes, highlighting potential  gaps in trip purpose documentation. 

These findings enable stakeholders to identify opportunities for improving resource  allocation, enhancing customer satisfaction, and optimizing marketing strategies to balance  business and personal trip categories. 
 
## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 1,156 entries with the following attributes:

• _START_DATE:_ Timestamp indicating the start of the trip. 

• _END_DATE:_ Timestamp indicating the end of the trip. 

• _CATEGORY:_ Trip classification as "Business" or "Personal." 

• _START:_ Starting location of the trip. 

• _STOP:_ Ending location of the trip. 

• _MILES:_ Distance travelled during the trip. 

• _PURPOSE:_ Purpose of the trip (e.g., Meeting, Customer Visit, Others). 

_**Data Challenges**_

The dataset posed the following challenges: 

• Missing values in key columns (CATEGORY and PURPOSE) impacted the accuracy  of initial analysis. 

• Inconsistent time formats required standardization for accurate time-based analysis. • Outliers in trip distance values required validation to ensure data integrity. 

These challenges were addressed during the data cleaning and transformation phase to ensure  accurate and reliable insights.

## Methodology

The analysis was performed using a structured approach, leveraging both descriptive and  visual analytics. The following steps were undertaken: 

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:

o Missing values were addressed by replacing blanks in the PURPOSE column  with "Others." 

o Inconsistent date and time formats were standardized using Microsoft Excel. 

o Outliers in the MILES column were validated and retained based on logical  thresholds. 

### 2. Data Transformation:
   
o Created new calculated columns in Power BI to group time into buckets (e.g.,  Morning, Afternoon, Evening).

o Generated quarterly and monthly aggregations for trends analysis. 

### 3. Data Analysis:
   
o Key metrics such as total miles, trip count, average trip distance, and top  categories were calculated. 

o Trends were analysed across dimensions like CATEGORY, PURPOSE, and  TIME. 

### 4. Visualization:
   
o Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI, incorporating visuals like pie  charts, bar graphs, and line charts to present insights effectively.
